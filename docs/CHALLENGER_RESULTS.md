# Challenger and combination results — 2026-10-02 (exploratory)

All runs used `.backup` copies of the stores and only already-used development seasons (NBA dataset 08fe2552c1aa4579, box
9ad11c5aa1590a46; NHL 5da8e01fc710d6a2), so none of this is evidence of prospective improvement. Reports:
`data/reports/{catboost,search}-{nba,nhl}-20261002/report.json`. Designs were committed before each run (docs/MODEL_SELECTION.md).

## CatBoost challenger (§10; design c3f5b3e, code 9f6bd8a; run 13:33–13:36 UTC) — **rejected**
Fixed 8-configuration grid, chosen on tuning seasons, scored once on held-out seasons. Lower is better.
| Task (held-out games) | Chosen config | CatBoost | Replaced member | Strongest (chosen on tuning seasons) | CatBoost − strongest [95%] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NBA winner, log loss (2024, 1,319) | depth 4, lr 0.03, l2 10 | 0.6169 | `gbt_v1` 0.6131 | `logistic_v2` 0.6082 | +0.0087 [+0.0024, +0.0161] |
| NBA margin log score (2024, 1,319) | depth 4, lr 0.03, l2 10 | 4.128 | `gbt_points` 4.086 | `ridge_points` 4.073 | +0.055 [+0.030, +0.080] |
| NHL winner, log loss (2020–21, 2,164) | depth 4, lr 0.03, l2 10 | 0.6754 | `hockey_gbt` 0.6753 | `hockey_logistic` 0.6724 | +0.0030 [−0.0013, +0.0076] |
CatBoost's per-game variance (RMSEWithUncertainty) was poorly calibrated: tuning scores ranged 4.07–5.73 across the grid. With
these features, simple regularised linear models remain best. Not deployed; the code stays as a research command only.

## Combination search (§11; design 826983d; run 13:35–13:41 UTC) — **nothing qualified, nothing deployed**
1,655 predefined rules per NBA market and fold (925 NHL winner, 345 reg3, 405 other NHL markets), each also within four
pregame condition levels. Rolling origin: NBA select 2022 → assess 2023, select 2022–23 → assess 2024; NHL select earlier
seasons → assess 2019, 2020, 2021. Comparator: the strongest single member chosen on the selection seasons, most-confident
games at the same count.
- **No rule passed the Bonferroni lower bound on selection data in any sport, market or fold** (z ≈ 4.0 NBA). With ~100–300
  picks a rule needs a lift of roughly +0.15 to pass; the best observed selection lifts were +0.04 to +0.20 with lower bounds
  −0.06 to −0.20.
- **The best-by-point-estimate rules (frozen, assessed for transparency) did not hold up consistently:** NBA winner +0.011
  (2023) and 0.000 (2024); NBA spread 0.000 and −0.055; NHL winner −0.073, +0.053, no picks. Some line-market rules built on the
  weekly `ridge_points` member stayed positive (NBA total +0.122 on 41 picks; team total away +0.064 on 311 picks, both at
  the primary's own model line) — descriptive only; that member is now recorded prospectively, where this can be tested.
- **Probability averages (complementarity):** the best average of any subset barely beats the best single member:
  NBA winner `elo+logistic_v2` = `logistic_v2` (0.62968); NBA spread +0.00003 nats; NBA total `points_normal+gbt_points@weekly`
  −0.0018 vs `points_normal`; NHL winner `hockey_elo+hockey_logistic` −0.0001; NHL spread `goals_poisson+goals_glm` −0.0005.
  So weaker members add at most small probability information; agreement selection added none beyond confidence.
- **Limit:** line markets are scored at the primary's model-only line (no historical bookmaker lines), so "agreement against
  the bookmaker" can be measured only prospectively — which the live research cohorts now record.
